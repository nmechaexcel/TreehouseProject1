      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>As a student and a future software engineer, I have versed myself well in the syntax of some programming languages like C, C++ and python which i was introduced to at my university. While this was happening, I helped in the development of websites for some small-time companies. I also helped to grow the social media handles of these said companies.</p>
